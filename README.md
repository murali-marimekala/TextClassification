## Important Points to Know

1. **Corpus**: A collection of text is also called a corpus in NLP.
2. **Vocabulary**: A list of words that occurred in our text where each word has its own index. This enables us to create a vector for a sentence.
3. **Vectorization**: Once a sentence is finalized, we vectorize and count each occurrence in the vocabulary. The resulting vector will be the length of the vocabulary and a count for each word in the vocabulary. The resulting vector is also called a feature vector.
4. **Feature Vector**: In a feature vector, each dimension can be a numeric categorical feature. These are crucial pieces in data science and machine learning, as the model you want to train depends on them.
5. **Overfitting**: Overfitting occurs when a model is trained too well on the training data. We need to avoid overfitting as this would result in high accuracy with the training data but low accuracy with the testing data.
